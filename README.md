# Real_Estate_Home_Hunting_Property_Agent_Analysis

A Real estate agent works under a licensed broker (or brokerage). The brokerage provides the real estate agent with leads (leads are people who are looking to buy, sell or rent), and the agent's job is to help them in their home buying, selling or renting process. They do this by making calls and regularly following-up with them.

After every call with a lead, the agent leaves a note on the CRM(CRM is a Customer Relationship Manager, which is a tool that agents use to log data for a particular lead)


Activity objective: 
The objective here is to determine performance metrics for agents along with providing advice on what can be done to help agents improve. The medium of presenting can be anyway (Tableau, Shiny, Google sheets, PowerPoint, etc.). It should be presentable to brokers (clients). Visualizations are expected.
